 The value of digital data: enhancing citizens' awareness and voice about surveillance capitalism
---


V-DATA project seeks to contribute to building a more balanced relation between **citizens** and [**surveillance capitalism**](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/) processes, as well as the actors that govern them. Specifically, on the one hand it seeks to filling the knowledge gap about Italian **public opinion** on dynamics and logics of surveillance capitalism, as well as on the risks of **inequality** and **discrimination** related to surveillance capitalism in Italy. On the other hand, it seeks to raise the public awareness on these issues, thus potentially enhancing citizensâ€™ ability to questioning these processes.
