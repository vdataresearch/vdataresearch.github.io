 The value of digital data: enhancing citizens' awareness and voice about surveillance capitalism
---

The term [**surveillance capitalism**](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/) does not refer specifically to digital technologies of social monitoring, rather to an emergent economic logic based on a unilateral extraction of digital data from **citizens**, which are used to perfecting algorithms, investing in the profitable market of artificial intelligence, and selling prediction products to companies that need to profile users.

V-DATA project seeks to contribute to building a more balanced relation between citizens and surveillance capitalism processes, as well as the actors that govern them. Specifically, on the one hand it seeks to filling the knowledge gap about Italian **public opinion** on dynamics and logics of surveillance capitalism, as well as on the risks of **inequality** and **discrimination** related to surveillance capitalism in Italy. On the other hand, it seeks to raise the public awareness on these issues, thus potentially enhancing citizensâ€™ ability to questioning these processes.
