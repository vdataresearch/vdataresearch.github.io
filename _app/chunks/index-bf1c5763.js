Therefore, the whole system relies on the unbalance between those subjected to exploitation and those who manage the data: this unbalance potentially creates or perpetuates social injustice.
Among the most extensively researched disparities within surveillance capitalism are related to privacy issues. However, there are other serious potential social harms associated with the conventional practices of surveillance capitalism. For instance, scholars have begun to examine potential discriminatory and exclusionary threats that may arise due to the extensive utilization of data, but this area of study still requires significant development.
Our study aims at contributing to the reflection on social justice issues related to surveillance capitalism practices, other than privacy. We focus on the Italian context, still an understudied case. The study has so far entailed the organization of 3 online focus groups (March and April 2023) with 11 total participants (both digital activists and experts). The main themes for discussion proposed in the sessions were the following: social injustice linked to surveillance capitalism processes; specific social, cultural or economic characteristics of the Italian context in relation to the theme; resistance practices in the Italian context.`),M=u(),k=o("p"),X=r("The research question guiding our work is: "),C=o("em"),D=r("Which are the specificities of the Italian context that can constitute a breeding ground for the potential harms deriving from surveillance capitalism practices?"),Q=u(),A=o("p"),x=r("Insights derived from our conversations with activists and experts show that, at the moment, Italy is far from having the conditions allowing to prevent and contrast the possible harms of surveillance capitalism processes. The themes around which the participants\u2019 narration about this general issue has focused are now discussed more in detail.  Overall, it is interesting to note that the aspects emerged and discussed during focus groups are not specifically linked to the economic aspects of surveillance capitalism (i.e.: the appropriation of economic value, without redistribution): these aspects seem much more invisible and difficult to \u2018visualize\u2019 and \u2018verbalize\u2019 even for experts."),J=u(),H=o("h4"),j=r("Theme 1 - Lack of awareness and debate"),U=u(),B=o("p"),F=r(`Participants lamented the absence of informed, specialized and professional public and political debate on the topic of surveillance capitalism and its potential harms:

Therefore, the whole system relies on the unbalance between those subjected to exploitation and those who manage the data: this unbalance potentially creates or perpetuates social injustice.
Among the most extensively researched disparities within surveillance capitalism are related to privacy issues. However, there are other serious potential social harms associated with the conventional practices of surveillance capitalism. For instance, scholars have begun to examine potential discriminatory and exclusionary threats that may arise due to the extensive utilization of data, but this area of study still requires significant development.
Our study aims at contributing to the reflection on social justice issues related to surveillance capitalism practices, other than privacy. We focus on the Italian context, still an understudied case. The study has so far entailed the organization of 3 online focus groups (March and April 2023) with 11 total participants (both digital activists and experts).

Also, a close reading of a sample of 30 articles was conducted. Results show that the topic of surveillance capitalism is composed by six main sub-topics: marketing & social control, big data & datafication, platforms & platformization, data privacy & protection, culture of surveillance, AI. We argue that all these key sub-topics need to be addressed attentively (or at least taken into consideration) when dealing with academic research and/or writing on surveillance capitalism, also paying attention on how each dimension inform and co-construct each other."),se.forEach(e),C=d(h),Xt(D.$$.fragment,h),Q=d(h),A=s(h,"H6",{});var te=l(A);x=c(te,"Mapping the culture of surveillance capitalism on Twitter"),te.forEach(e),J=d(h),H=s(h,"P",{});var S=l(H);j=c(S,"Although surveillance capitalism is already well-established in advanced economies, we can argue that the current Covid-19 emergence has probably accelerate the diffusion of surveillance capitalism logics and infrastructures (e.g., platformization of higher education). Despite the pervasiveness and currency of this phenomenon, we still know very little about how the general public perceives and frames it. In particular, there is a shortage of empirical research on citizens\u2019 opinions towards surveillance capitalism as well as their level of awareness about the processes of data exploitation and value extraction carried out by corporate platforms on the very data users produce through their everyday digital practices. To address this research gap, we developed an exploration (based on digital methods) on dataset of 302k Italian tweets (collected by following ad hoc keywords, such as \u2018surveillance + Facebook\u2019, \u2018surveillance + iPhone\u2019, etc). We analyzed this dataset combining computational and qualitative techniques \u2013 network analysis, topic modelling, ethnographic content analysis. Our preliminary results show that, on a general level, Twitter users seem unable to distinguish between processes of surveillance upon citizens and consumers (which they consider basically the same thing). Anyhow, on a micro level, specific communities of users tend to develop different narratives on surveillance capitalism, imagining different \u2018models\u2019 of it (such as, dystopian surveillance, benevolent surveillance, conspiracy surveillance, entertainment surveillance)."),S.forEach(e),U=d(h),Xt(B.$$.fragment,h),F=d(h),v=s(h,"H6",{});var K=l(v);L=c(K,"Algorithmic countersurveillance Immuni on Reddit"),K.forEach(e),_=d(h),G=s(h,"P",{});var re=l(G);Z=c(re,"This research proposes a reflection on the implications of dataveillance (based on algorithms) and practices of countersurveillance in the healthcare field. Countersurveillance is the practice of making surveillance activities of institutions difficult or implementing technologies to evade surveillance altogether. Countersurveillance achieves its goal by subverting various components of the surveillance process and it has many applications. It can be used to protect privacy, civil liberties, and against abuses of surveillance. Additionally, it may be employed to push surveillance systems beyond their breaking point and in doing so it identifies potential vulnerabilities and points of error. Many countersurveillance techniques use human methods rather than electronic; these activities might include \u2018evasion\u2019 (e.g., avoiding risky locations, being discreet or using code words), \u2018being situation-aware\u2019; \u2018hiding in secure locations\u2019; and \u2018concealing one\u2019s identity\u2019.
