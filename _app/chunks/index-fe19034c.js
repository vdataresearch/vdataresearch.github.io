We analyzed this dataset combining computational and qualitative techniques \u2013 network analysis, topic modelling, ethnographic content analysis. Our preliminary results show that, on a general level, Twitter users seem unable to distinguish between processes of surveillance upon citizens and consumers (which they consider basically the same thing). Anyhow, on a micro level, specific communities of users tend to develop different narratives on surveillance capitalism, imagining different \u2018models\u2019 of it (such as, dystopian surveillance, benevolent surveillance, conspiracy surveillance, entertainment surveillance)."),A.forEach(e),X=u(h),Xt(j.$$.fragment,h),F=u(h),w=s(h,"H6",{});var K=l(w);R=c(K,"Algorithmic countersurveillance Immuni on Reddit"),K.forEach(e),N=u(h),Y=s(h,"P",{});var re=l(Y);Z=c(re,"This research proposes a reflection on the implications of dataveillance (based on algorithms) and practices of countersurveillance in the healthcare field. Countersurveillance is the practice of making surveillance activities of institutions difficult or implementing technologies to evade surveillance altogether. Countersurveillance achieves its goal by subverting various components of the surveillance process and it has many applications. It can be used to protect privacy, civil liberties, and against abuses of surveillance. Additionally, it may be employed to push surveillance systems beyond their breaking point and in doing so it identifies potential vulnerabilities and points of error. Many countersurveillance techniques use human methods rather than electronic; these activities might include \u2018evasion\u2019 (e.g., avoiding risky locations, being discreet or using code words), \u2018being situation-aware\u2019; \u2018hiding in secure locations\u2019; and \u2018concealing one\u2019s identity\u2019.
