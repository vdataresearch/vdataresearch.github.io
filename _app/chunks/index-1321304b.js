In 2022 the 67.1% of the World population is connected to the Internet (WeAreSocial, 2022), through a multiplicity of devices. Being constantly online, people generate enormous quantities of data on basically everything: shopping behaviours, political orientations, health status, etc. (boyd & Crawford, 2012). This huge amount of data is the \u2018fuel\u2019 of the contemporary digital economy (The Economist, 2017). The leaders of the digital economy are companies structured as platforms (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, etc.), which, on the one hand, intermediate relations among different groups of actors (consumers, advertisers, developers, etc.) (Gillespie, 2010), while, on the other hand, extract data from these very users, as well as their interactions (Srnicek, 2017). Platforms control over data goes well beyond the digital boundaries of the corporate platform, extending to the open Web (Helmond, 2015), mobile phones (Nieborg et al., 2020), households (Pridmore & Mols, 2020) and public institutions (Van Dijck et al., 2018). These massive and systematic processes of data extraction are at the base of the business model of digital platforms, which use data for: a) internal marketing purposes (Beer, 2018); b) selling them to third parties (for their own scopes of advertising and marketing) (van der Vlist & Helmond, 2021); c) developing new products and/or markets (vocal assistants, self-driving cars, etc.) (Hind et al., 2022)`),Gt=c(),Se=o("p"),Xi=l(`Zuboff (2019) calls this emerging form of economic and socio-technical organisation surveillance capitalism. The term does not refer specifically to digital technologies of social monitoring, rather to an economic logic based on a unilateral extraction and accumulation of digital data from citizens, which are used to predict, personalise, customise and ultimately constrain their behaviours for business purposes (Mackenzie, 2019; M\xFChlhoff, 2020). In fact, Wood and Monahan (2019) frame this phenomenon as \u2018platform surveillance\u2019, meaning that it would not be possible outside the complex array of tracking devices, digital interfaces, algorithmic systems, and data analytics deployed (and owned) by corporate digital platforms.
Despite the pervasiveness and currency of the phenomenon as well as its huge socio-economic impact (Beer, 2017; Arvidsson, 2019), empirical research in this field is still in its infancy (Ball & Webster 2020; Pizzul & Caliandro, 2022). Whereas platforms have a granular knowledge on social life, social actors seem to know very little about them - it is not easy to understand how they function, what kind of data they harvest, for which purpose etc; in other words, they are \u2018opaque\u2019 by design (Pasquale, 2015; Yeung, 2017). Curiously enough, such lack of empirical knowledge and data seems to reflect the asymmetries of power and information/knowledge typical of surveillance capitalism (Fuchs, 2021).`),Jt=c(),Ee=o("p"),Ki=l("Currently, the scientific debate on datafication, dataveillance and data exploitation (Dijck, 2014) tend to focus mostly on privacy (Lutz et al., 2020). Questions of data protection are indubitably of great concern, since privacy is a human right connected to human dignity. Nevertheless, issues related to value appropriation are equally important, since digital data generated by citizens through their online activities produce a conspicuous economic value that is extracted from the social but not redistributed within the social."),Ot=c(),ke=o("p"),Zi=l("In this regard, several key questions remain still unanswered, such as: do people perceive the economical value of their data? If so, to what extent? If not, why? What is really valuable for them? How does the concept of data value change according to different stakeholders (consumers, marketers, brands, analysts, etc.) as well as market segments (e.g. automotive, food, fashion, etc.)? How does the concept of data value change across different socio-economic groups? How does the concept of data value change across different cultures and geographies (West vs East, North vs South)? How do people protect their data in everyday life? Do they develop practices of resistance individually or collectively? Why do people give up their data? For which economical bargain? How do platforms themselves shape forms of resistance, negotiation, and compliance towards surveillance capitalism?

In 2022 the 67.1% of the World population is connected to the Internet (WeAreSocial, 2022), through a multiplicity of devices. Being constantly online, people generate enormous quantities of data on basically everything: shopping behaviours, political orientations, health status, etc. (boyd & Crawford, 2012). This huge amount of data is the \u2018fuel\u2019 of the contemporary digital economy (The Economist, 2017). The leaders of the digital economy are companies structured as platforms (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, etc.), which, on the one hand, intermediate relations among different groups of actors (consumers, advertisers, developers, etc.) (Gillespie, 2010), while, on the other hand, extract data from these very users, as well as their interactions (Srnicek, 2017). Platforms control over data goes well beyond the digital boundaries of the corporate platform, extending to the open Web (Helmond, 2015), mobile phones (Nieborg et al., 2020), households (Pridmore & Mols, 2020) and public institutions (Van Dijck et al., 2018). These massive and systematic processes of data extraction are at the base of the business model of digital platforms, which use data for: a) internal marketing purposes (Beer, 2018); b) selling them to third parties (for their own scopes of advertising and marketing) (van der Vlist & Helmond, 2021); c) developing new products and/or markets (vocal assistants, self-driving cars, etc.) (Hind et al., 2022)`),en.forEach(t),Gt=d(i),Se=n(i,"P",{});var tn=r(Se);Xi=s(tn,`Zuboff (2019) calls this emerging form of economic and socio-technical organisation surveillance capitalism. The term does not refer specifically to digital technologies of social monitoring, rather to an economic logic based on a unilateral extraction and accumulation of digital data from citizens, which are used to predict, personalise, customise and ultimately constrain their behaviours for business purposes (Mackenzie, 2019; M\xFChlhoff, 2020). In fact, Wood and Monahan (2019) frame this phenomenon as \u2018platform surveillance\u2019, meaning that it would not be possible outside the complex array of tracking devices, digital interfaces, algorithmic systems, and data analytics deployed (and owned) by corporate digital platforms.
Despite the pervasiveness and currency of the phenomenon as well as its huge socio-economic impact (Beer, 2017; Arvidsson, 2019), empirical research in this field is still in its infancy (Ball & Webster 2020; Pizzul & Caliandro, 2022). Whereas platforms have a granular knowledge on social life, social actors seem to know very little about them - it is not easy to understand how they function, what kind of data they harvest, for which purpose etc; in other words, they are \u2018opaque\u2019 by design (Pasquale, 2015; Yeung, 2017). Curiously enough, such lack of empirical knowledge and data seems to reflect the asymmetries of power and information/knowledge typical of surveillance capitalism (Fuchs, 2021).`),tn.forEach(t),Jt=d(i),Ee=n(i,"P",{});var an=r(Ee);Ki=s(an,"Currently, the scientific debate on datafication, dataveillance and data exploitation (Dijck, 2014) tend to focus mostly on privacy (Lutz et al., 2020).

How does the concept of data value change across different socio-economic groups? How does the concept of data value change across different cultures and geographies (West vs East, North vs South)? How do people protect their data in everyday life? Do they develop practices of resistance individually or collectively? Why do people give up their data? For which economical bargain?
