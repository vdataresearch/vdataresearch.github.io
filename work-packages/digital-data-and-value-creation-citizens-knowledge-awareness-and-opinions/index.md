We will collect primary data through two different methods: 1) we will conduct a probabilistic national survey with an experimental research design; 2) we will conduct a qualitative small-scale art-based research, adopting a digital ethnography approach. Survey data will be analysed using a set of multivariate analysis techniques that will vary in relation to the nature of the data, the measurement properties of dependent variables, and  the research questions we intend to answer. Qualitative data will be analysed through a process of open and axial coding.
