Digital methods will be employed to collect and analyze data from online news media outlets and Twitter. The sources have been chosen because we are interested in exploring both the debate developing around news, promoted by news media outlets, and the interactions between institutional (politicians, corporations etc.) and regular users developing on social media platforms. Data from news media outlets will be collected through open source tools (e.g. Googlescarper and Media Cloud) by following ad hoc keywords. Data from Twitter will be collected through the academic Twitter API. Data analysis will be based on both manual and automated techniques of network, content and sentiment analysis.
