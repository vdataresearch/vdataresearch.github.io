Digital methods will be employed to collect and analyze data from online news media  outlets and Twitter. The sources have been chosen because we are interested in exploring  both the debate developing around news, promoted by news media outlets, and the  interactions between institutional (politicians, corporations etc.) and regular users  developing on social media platforms. Data from news media outlets will be collected  through open source tools (e.g. Googlescarper and Media Cloud) by following ad hoc keywords. Data from Twitter will be collected through the academic Twitter API. Data  analysis will be based on both manual and automated techniques of network, content and sentiment analysis.
