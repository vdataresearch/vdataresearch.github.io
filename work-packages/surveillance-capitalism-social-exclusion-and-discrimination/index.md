We will conduct a desk research in order to identify and analyse already existing initiatives of data activism, specifically addressed to prevent and tackle social exclusion and discrimination in digital data extraction and exploitation. We will conduct 4 brainstorming sessions involving at least 6 key informants each, in order to explore the risks of social exclusion and discrimination stemming from processes of digital data extraction and exploitation. Key informants will be selected among experts and activists in the fields of diversity and inclusion, digital divide and digital inequalities, data justice. We will analyze data from brainstorming through a process of open and axial coding. 
Drawing upon the research findings, we will elaborate recommendations (white paper) to  prevent and address risks of exclusion and discrimination in digital data extraction and  exploitation in Italy.
